# Running the Portfolio Website Locally

To view the portfolio website properly, it is recommended to run a local HTTP server in the `website` directory. This ensures all resources like CSS and JavaScript load correctly.

## Using Python 3

If you have Python 3 installed, you can run a simple HTTP server with the following commands:

```bash
cd website
python -m http.server 8000
```

This will start a local server at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). Open this URL in your browser to view the website.

## Using VSCode Live Server Extension

If you use Visual Studio Code, you can install the Live Server extension:

1. Open the `website` folder in VSCode.
2. Right-click on `index.html` and select **Open with Live Server**.
3. This will launch the website in your default browser with a local server.
